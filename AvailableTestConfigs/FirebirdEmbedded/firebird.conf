# Firebird configuration file
#
# Comments
# --------
# The # character is used for comments and can be placed anywhere on a
# line.  Anything following the # character on a line is considered a
# comment.
#
# Examples:
#
#    # This is a comment
#    DefaultDbCachePages = 2048   # This is an end-of-line comment
#
# Entries
# -------
# The default value for each entry is listed to the right of the "=".
# To activate an entry, remove the leading "#"s and supply the desired
# value.
#
# Please note, a number of the values are specified in **Bytes** (Not KB).
# Accordingly, we have provided some simple conversion tables at the bottom
# of this file.
#
# There are three types of configuration values: integer, boolean and string.
#
# Integer
# --------
# Integers is what they sound like, an integral value. Examples:
#   1
#   42
#   4711
#
# Boolean
# -------
# Boolean is expressed as integer values with 0 (zero) being "false" and
# non-zero is taken to mean "true". For consistency we recommend you
# only use 0/1.
#
# String
# ------
# Strings are also what they sound like, strings. Examples:
#   RootDirectory  = /opt/firebird
#   RemotePipeName = pipe47

# ----------------------------
# Specify the root directory under which Firebird is installed.
# Can be used to override the OS-specifically determined one.
#
# Type: string
#
#RootDirectory =


# ----------------------------
# Database Paths/Directories
#
# DatabaseAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose Restrict,
# provide ';'-separated trees list, where database files are stored.
# Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value 'Full' gives full access to all files
# on your site. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required
# paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\DataBase;D:\Mirror',
# for unix - '/db;/mnt/mirrordb'). If you choose 'None', then only
# databases listed in aliases.conf can be attached.
#
# Note: simple quotation marks shown above should *NOT* be used when
# specifying values and directory path names. Examples:
#
# DatabaseAccess = None
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict C:\DataBase
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict C:\DataBase;D:\Mirror
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict /db
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict /db;/mnt/mirrordb

# External File Paths/Directories
#
# ExternalFileAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose
# Restrict, provide ';'-separated trees list, where external files
# are stored. Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value 'None' disables any use of external files
# on your site. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required
# paths (for Win32 this may be something like 'C:\ExternalTables',
# for unix - '/db/extern;/mnt/extern').
#
# NOTE: THE EXTERNAL TABLE ENGINE FEATURE COULD BE USED TO COMPROMISE

#
# Default value 'Restrict UDF' provides the same restrictions
# as in FB 1.0. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required

#UdfAccess = Restrict UDF


# ----------------------------
# Temporary directories
#
# Provide ';'-separated trees list, where temporary files are stored.
# Relative paths are treated relative to RootDirectory entry
# (see above). Default value is determined using FIREBIRD_TMP,
# TEMP or TMP environment options. Once the first specified

# Makes no difference when used with original
# security2.fdb - it can't contain DES hash.
#
# Type: boolean

#LegacyHash = 1

# ----------------------------
# Which authentication method(s) should be used.
# "native" means use of only traditional interbase/firebird
# authentication with security database.
# "trusted" (Windows Only) makes use of window trusted authentication,

#MaxUserTraceLogSize = 10


# ----------------------------
# Number of cached database pages
#
# This sets the number of pages from any one database that can be held
# in cache at once. If you increase this value, the engine will
# allocate more pages to the cache for every database. By default, the
# SuperServer allocates 2048 pages for each database and the classic
# allocates 75 pages per client connection per database.
#
# Type: integer
#
#DefaultDbCachePages = 2048

# ----------------------------
# Disk space preallocation
#
# Sets the amount of preallocated disk space in bytes. Disk space
# preallocation allows to reduce physical file fragmentation and to make 
# database work in out of disk space condition. With preallocation enabled,
# engine allocates 1/16nth of already allocated disk space at a time but 
# not less than 128KB and no more than DatabaseGrowthIncrement (128MB by 
# default). To disable preallocation set DatabaseGrowthIncrement to zero.
# Shadow database files are not preallocated.
#
# Type: integer
#
#DatabaseGrowthIncrement = 134217728

# ----------------------------
# File system cache threshold
#
# The threshold value that determines whether Firebird will use file system
# cache or not. File system caching is used if database cache size in pages 
# (configured explicitly in database header or via DefaultDbCachePages setting)
# is less than FileSystemCacheThreshold value.
#
# To use file system cache always set FileSystemCacheThreshold to a large value.
# To bypass file system cache for all databases set FileSystemCacheThreshold to 
# zero.
# 
# Type: integer, measured in database pages
#
#FileSystemCacheThreshold = 65536

# ----------------------------
# File system cache size
#
# This setting controls the maximum amount of RAM used by Windows file system
# cache on 64-bit Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 SP1 or later host. It has no
# effect for Unix hosts in this release yet.
#
# Note that the lowest number presently supported is 10%, and the highest number
# is 95%; numbers outside these limits will be set to the default of 30%.
#
# If the cache size has already been selected when the engine starts the host
# setting will not be changed. Thus you may need to reboot the host for the
# change of this setting to have effect.
#
# To leave host caching settings unchanged set this parameter to 0. This is
# the default parameter value.
#
# Security note
# To adjust the setting engine needs SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege right. Built-in
# service accounts and administrators have it by default. Installer grants this
# right to Firebird service account. If the engine fails to adjust the cache 
# size setting it will log warning message to the firebird.log and continue.
#
# Type: integer, measured in % of total physical RAM
#
#FileSystemCacheSize = 0

# ----------------------------
# Remove protection against opening databases on NFS mounted volumes on
# Linux/Unix and SMB/CIFS volumes on Windows.
#
# This also permits creating database shadows on mounted network volumes.
#
#     ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING***
#
# This option removes an important safety feature of Firebird and can
# cause irrecoverable database corruption. Do not use this option unless
# you understand the risks and are prepared to accept the loss of the
# contents of your database.
# Unless this configuration option is changed from 0 to 1, Firebird can
# open a database only if the database is stored on a drive physically
# attached to the local computer - the computer running that copy of
# Firebird. Requests for connections to databases stored on NFS mounted
# drives are redirected to a Firebird server running on the computer that
# "owns" the disk.
# This restriction prevents two different copies of Firebird from opening
# the same database without coordinating their activities. Uncoordinated
# access by multiple copies of Firebird will corrupt a database. On a local
# system, the system-level file locking prevents uncoordinated access to
# the database file.
#
# NFS does not provide a reliable way to detect multiple users of a file on
# an NFS mounted disk. If a second copy of Firebird connects to a database on
# an NFS mounted disk, it will corrupt the database.
# Under some circumstances, running a Firebird server on the computer that
# owns NFS mounted volumes is inconvenient or impossible. Applications that
# use the "embedded" variant of Firebird and never share access to a database
# can use this option to permit direct access to databases on NFS mounted
# volumes.
#
# The situation for SMB/CIFS is quite similar to NFS with not all configurations
# providing file locking mechanisms needed for safe operation. Using SuperServer
# engine with the database on NT file server may be considered relatively safe 
# as file locking protects the database from being used by the several engines.
# Network stack can still change order of writes so you may get a corrupted
# database in case of network errors or power outage.
#
# The useful and safe case is working with a shared database marked read-only.
#
# DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

# ----------------------------
# Temporary space management
#
# Temporary storage is used by the sorting module, it's also

# The smallest block size being allocated in the temporary storage.
# This value reflects the allocation granularity.
#
# Type: integer
#
#TempBlockSize = 1048576

#
# The maximum amount of the temporary space that can be cached

#
# For Classic servers, this setting is defaulted to 8 MB.
# Although it can be increased, the value applies to each client
# connection/server instance and thus consumes a lot of memory.
#
# Type: integer
#
#TempCacheLimit = 67108864


# ----------------------------
# Boolean evaluation method (complete or shortcut)
#
# If your SQL code depends on side-effects of full evaluation of OR
# and AND statements (right-hand-side terms), even if the expressions
# final result could be determined by just examining the value of the
# first term, you might need to turn this on.

# Type: boolean
#
#CompleteBooleanEvaluation = 0


# ----------------------------
#
# Determines the number of seconds that the lock manager will wait after a
# conflict has been encountered before purging locks from dead processes

#
# Type: integer
#
#DeadlockTimeout = 10


# ----------------------------
#
# How often the pages are flushed on disk
# (for databases with ForcedWrites=Off only)
#
# Number of unflushed writes which will accumulate before they are

# Type: integer
#
#MaxUnflushedWriteTime = 5


# ----------------------------
#
# This option controls whether to call abort() when internal error or BUGCHECK
# is encountered thus invoke post-mortem debugger which can dump core suitable
# for off-line analysis. When disabled engine tries to minimize damage and
# continue execution.
#
# Note that setting this option to 1 makes engine produce traceable coredumps
# when something nasty like SIGSEGV happens inside UDF. On Windows enabling
# this option makes engine invoke JIT debugger facilities when errors happen.
#
# For debugging builds (DEV_BUILD), default value is 1 (Enabled)
#
# Type: boolean
#
#BugcheckAbort = 0


# Prior to Firebird 1.5 various SELECT expressions generated unnamed
# columns. This did not conform to the SQL standard. Fb 1.5 saw the
# introduction of default aliases for these unnamed columns. In some
# cases, particularly if string concatenation is used (via the ||
# operator) this breaks existing scripts.
#
# This setting will affect aliases generated via CONCATENATION,
# CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and EXTRACT. Setting
# the value to true will disable the alias generation. It is only
# recommended to be used where legacy scripts need to be supported.
# It will be marked deprecated in Firebird 2.0 and removed in
# Firebird 3.0.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#OldColumnNaming = 0


# Prior to Firebird 2.5 the SET clause of the UPDATE statement assigned
# columns in the user-defined order with the NEW column values being
# immediately accessible to the subsequent assignments. This did not
# conform to the SQL standard. Starting with Firebird 2.5, only OLD column
# values are accessible to all the assignments of the SET clause.
#
# Example of the old vs new behaviour:
#
# UPDATE T SET A = B, B = A
# old result: A gets equal to B, B doesn't change
# new result: A and B get their values exchanged
#
# Change this configuration option to 1 (true) only if your SQL code relies
# on the legacy semantics of the SET clause. It's provided as a temporary
# solution for backward compatibility issues and will be deprecated in
# future Firebird versions.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#OldSetClauseSemantics = 0


# ----------------------------
# Relaxing relation alias checking rules in SQL
#
# Since Firebird 2.0, strict alias checking rules were implemented in the SQL
# parser to accord with the SQL standard requirements. This setting allows
# these rules to be relaxed in order to allow legacy applications to run on 
# Firebird 2.0.
# A setting of 1 (true) allows the parser to resolve a qualified column reference 
# using the relation name, where an alias has been specified for that relation.
#
# For example, it allows a query such as:
#       SELECT TABLE.X FROM TABLE A
#
# It is not recommended to enable this setting. It should be regarded as an 
# interim workaround for porting untidy legacy code, until it is practicable to 
# revise such code. 
# 
# CAUTION!
# There is no guarantee that this setting will be available in future Firebird

# or may not prevent eventual inactive client disconnection for other OS.
#
# Normally, Firebird uses SO_KEEPALIVE socket option to keep track of

# but often possible), it will work as a gateway for incoming requests like:
# firebird.your.domain.com:internal_server:/private/database.fdb
# It's enough to know name/IP of some internal server on your LAN, and for
