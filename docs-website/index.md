## What is FluentMigrator?

FluentMigrator is a migration framework for .NET that allows you to manage database schema changes in a structured, version-controlled way. Instead of manually running SQL scripts, you write migrations as C# classes that can be executed automatically.

## The Problem

Traditional database development often involves:
- Manual SQL scripts that need to be run by each developer
- No clear versioning of database changes
- Risk of inconsistencies between development, testing, and production environments
- Difficulty tracking what changes have been applied
- Database-specific SQL that doesn't work across different providers

## The Solution

FluentMigrator solves these problems by:
- **Code-based migrations**: Database changes are written in C# using a fluent API
- **Version control**: Migrations are part of your codebase and can be checked into source control
- **Automatic tracking**: FluentMigrator keeps track of which migrations have been applied
- **Database agnostic**: Write once, run on multiple database providers
- **Rollback support**: Define both Up and Down methods for reversible migrations

```csharp
[Migration(20240101000000)]
public class CreateUsersTable : Migration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        Create.Table("Users")
            .WithColumn("Id").AsInt32().NotNullable().PrimaryKey().Identity()
            .WithColumn("Username").AsString(50).NotNullable().Unique()
            .WithColumn("Email").AsString(255).NotNullable()
            .WithColumn("CreatedAt").AsDateTime().NotNullable().WithDefault(SystemMethods.CurrentDateTime);
    }

    public override void Down()
    {
        Delete.Table("Users");
    }
}
```

## Benefits

### Clear syntax
* FluentMigrator uses a fluent API that reads like natural language:

### Version Control Integration
- Migrations are C# code files that integrate naturally with version control
- Easy to see what changed and when
- Collaborative development without merge conflicts
- Branching and merging of schema changes

### Database Provider Independence
- SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL / MariaDB
- SQLite
- Oracle
- Firebird
- And more...

Write your migrations once and run them on any supported database.

### Team Development
- All team members can apply the same schema changes
- New developers can get up to date with a single command
- No more "Did you remember to run this script?" conversations

### CI/CD Integration
- Migrations can be automatically applied as part of deployment
- Consistent schema updates across all environments
- Reduced deployment errors
